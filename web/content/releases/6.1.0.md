The following notable changes and new features were implemented between OpenGeoSys 6.0.8 and 6.1.0:

### Features:

#### New processes:
- ComponentTransport https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1758
- PhaseField https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1813 and https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1895
- RichardsComponentTransport https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1929
- ThermoMechanics https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1800
- TwoPhaseFlow p-rho https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1613

#### Other process' changes:
- New equation assembly approach for the staggered scheme. With that,  the
  coupling assembly computations are  changed from  performing assembly across
  the different Process classes for a coupling to a single Process class for
  coupled processes, which was assumed only for the monolithic before. With the
  changes, the original Process class that for monolithic scheme originally can
  now handle both of the monolithic and staggered schemes.  So far,  HT classes
  get the staggered scheme based on this new framework of  assembly.
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1970
- Heterogeneous liquid flow properties  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1979,
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2017)
- New boundary conditions added: Nonuniform Dirichlet
  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1952) and Neumann
  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1891), and normal traction
  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1896)
- Framework for time stepping and a first application of adaptive time stepping,
  EvolutionaryPIDcontroller, and automatic time step control
  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1803).
- Nodal source terms (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1977)
- Fix deformation processes to work correctly with PETSc parallelization
  (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1838).
- Fix the access to local data of PETScVector (https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1797).
- Add damping factor to global Newton. https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2004
- Extend extrapolator to vectorial quantities and replace the component-wise
  output of Darcy velocity and the stress/strain in mechanical processes with
  single vectorial output.

#### Material model changes
- Separate FractureModels in LIE https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1971
- Add material forces as published in
  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093641317303865
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1936

#### Testing and documentation:
- Insitu visualization with ParaView Catalyst. See
  [presentation](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/files/867280/Insitu-Department.pdf).
  [#1744](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1744), [#1732](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1732). As a consequence VTK 7.1 is now required.
- Benchmark docs are now part of the code (in `web/content`) and can contain
  [interactive 3D
  visualizations](https://dev.opengeosys.org/docs/benchmarks/elliptic/groundwater-flow-neumann/#results-and-evaluation)
  via [vtk.js](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/). [#1706](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1706), [#1714](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1714), [#1723](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1723), [#1729](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1729).
- Migrated handling of test data files from *git-submodule* to *git-lfs*, see
  [docs](https://docs.opengeosys.org/docs/devguide/testing/test-data). [#1964](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1964),
  [#1982](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1982), [#1984](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1984), [#2010](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2010), [#2012](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2012).  Now  [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is
  required. Check the
  [installation](https://docs.opengeosys.org/docs/devguide/getting-started/prerequisites)
  instructions.

### Infrastructure:
- Fully moved to Conan for automatic third-party library handling. Can be
  enabled with `OGS_USE_CONAN=ON`, see
  [docs](https://docs.opengeosys.org/docs/devguide/advanced/conan-package-manager).
  [#1907](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1907)
- Conan version 1.0 is now required.
- Dropped travis CI environment and added few new tests on Jenkins because of
  simpler maintenance.

#### CMake options changes:
- `OGS_EIGEN_DYNAMIC_SHAPE_MATRICES` defaults to OFF on Release
  config, ON otherwise. Can be overridden by explicitly setting the option. [#1673](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1673)
- New `OGS_EIGEN_INITIALIZE_MATRICES_BY_NAN` defaults to ON for easier spotting
  of non-initialized matrices. When OFF, the Eigen's default initialization to 0
  is skipped resulting in slightly faster execution.
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1917
- Set default Eigen's cmake flag disabling vectorization since this lead to
  several problems in different environments.
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1919 and the issue linked there
  https://github.com/ufz/ogs/issues/1881

#### Other
- PETSc config is tested on Jenkins (envinf1)
- OGS binaries are provided as eve / envinf1 modules. See
  [docs](https://docs.opengeosys.org/docs/quickstart/basics/envinf1) for
  details. [#1753](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1753)
- Migrated Data Explorer to Qt5. [#1622](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1622), [#1625](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/1625)
- Windows builds are tested on MSVC 2017 on own hardware and on MS
