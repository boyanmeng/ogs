It defines sets of deactivated subdomains, each of which contains a time
 interval and material IDs. When the time is in the time interval of a set of
 deactivated subdomains, the elements in the deactivated subdomains are excluded
 from the local and global assembly, and also from the computation of the
 secondary variables.

Note: the nodes at the borders among active subdomains and inactive subdomains
 are included through the entire computations.
